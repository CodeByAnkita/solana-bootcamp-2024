# NFT Creation on Solana

This project demonstrates how to create and verify a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the Solana blockchain using the Metaplex and Umi libraries. By following this guide, you'll learn the steps to mint an NFT, verify it as part of a collection, and interact with it on the Solana Devnet.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- TypeScript
- Solana CLI
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode)

---

## Features

1. **NFT Creation:** Mint an NFT on the Solana blockchain.
2. **NFT Verification:** Verify the NFT as part of a specific collection.
3. **Umi Integration:** Use the Umi library to handle Solana transactions seamlessly.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/nft-creation-solana.git
cd nft-creation-solana
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create an NFT

Run the `create-nft.ts` script to mint an NFT:

```bash
npx esrun create-nft.ts
```

Once the script runs successfully, you‚Äôll see a log with the new NFT‚Äôs address, e.g.:

```plaintext
üñºÔ∏è Created NFT! Address is https://explorer.solana.com/address/Axzbx9TtTpiywP1AwYisHjh3Sho7FxACa82ksBboyCPe?cluster=devnet
```

---

## Verifying the NFT

To verify the NFT as part of a collection:

1. Edit the `verify-nft.ts` script and ensure it references the appropriate collection and NFT addresses.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
npx esrun verify-nft.ts
```

### Expected Output

Upon successful verification, the script will log:

```plaintext
‚úÖ NFT Axzbx9TtTpiywP1AwYisHjh3Sho7FxACa82ksBboyCPe verified as a member of collection 78bJjRKwSABh9YRUaFGEyPFCps7yVGKJxDwssU4XyUtU!
```

## Using a New Account

To set up a new account, you can use the following seed phrase to generate a keypair. **Keep this phrase safe and secure.**

**Seed Phrase:**
```
love edit curious find capital forest ladder tower actor extend october off
```

## Additional Commands

- To create a new NFT:
  ```bash
  npx esrun create-nft.ts
  ```

- To verify an existing NFT with a collection:
  ```bash
  npx esrun verify-nft.ts
  ```

---

## Notes

1. **Network:** This project operates on the **Solana Devnet** for testing purposes.
2. **Account Management:** Save your account's seed phrase and private key securely to avoid losing access to your wallet and NFTs.
3. **Customization:** Modify `create-collection.ts` and `verify-nft.ts` as needed to suit your project's requirements.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Metadata Account Not Found:** Ensure the NFT mint address is correct and has been successfully created on the blockchain.
- **Insufficient Balance:** Use the Solana CLI or Umi utilities to airdrop SOL to your Devnet wallet.

```bash
solana airdrop 2 <your-wallet-address> --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```
